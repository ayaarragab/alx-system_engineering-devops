# Postmortem Report: Web Stack Debugging Outage

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration**: May 7, 2024, 10:00 AM - May 7, 2024, 2:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact**: The web service hosted on the /var/www/html/wp-settings.php file experienced intermittent downtime, resulting in slow response times and sporadic errors for users accessing the WordPress website. Approximately 20% of users were affected during the outage.
- **Root Cause**: The incorrect file extension 'phpp' in the wp-settings.php file led to parsing errors and hindered the proper execution of the web service.

## Timeline:
- **10:00 AM**: The issue was detected by automated monitoring systems, which flagged increased error rates and latency in HTTP responses.
- **10:15 AM**: System administrators received alerts regarding the performance degradation.
- **10:30 AM**: Engineers investigated the issue, initially suspecting server resource constraints or network issues.
- **11:00 AM**: After reviewing server logs, it was noticed that the wp-settings.php file had an incorrect file extension ('phpp') instead of 'php'.
- **11:30 AM**: Attempts were made to manually edit the file extension, but due to its size and complexity, manual correction proved ineffective.
- **12:00 PM**: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for further assistance.
- **1:00 PM**: The DevOps team implemented a fix by using a Puppet script to automatically correct the file extension in wp-settings.php.
- **2:00 PM**: The issue was resolved, and normal service functionality was restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfigured file extension ('phpp') in the wp-settings.php file.
- The issue was resolved by executing a Puppet script that automatically corrected the file extension to 'php'. The script utilized the following command:
sed -i s/phpp/php/g /var/www/html/wp-settings.php

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Improve file validation processes to ensure correct file extensions are applied during deployment.
- Implement stricter monitoring for file integrity and configuration consistency.
- Task: Enhance Puppet scripts to automatically validate and correct file extensions during deployment processes.
- Task: Conduct regular audits of critical system files to identify and rectify any misconfigurations promptly.

This postmortem report provides a detailed analysis of the outage experienced during the web stack debugging process. By identifying the root cause and implementing corrective measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure the continued reliability of our web services.
